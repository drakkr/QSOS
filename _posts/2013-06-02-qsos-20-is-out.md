The new major version of QSOS is at last available!

We worked a lot towards this very moment. The 2.0 release comes with many changes.

### QSOS Formats
* XSD for QSOS format (available [here](https://raw.github.com/drakkr/QSOS/master/Tools/o3s/formats/xml/xsd/qsos.xsd))
* Freemind XSD for templates (available [here](https://raw.github.com/drakkr/QSOS/master/Tools/o3s/formats/xml/xsd/freemind.xsd))

### QSOS backend
* QSOS backend is now split in two repositories:

    + _Incoming_: community sandbox opened to any registered user

    + _Master_: QSOS certified evaluations and templates
* Templates and evaluations can be uploaded to the backends, this requires authentication

Connect to the [backend](http://backend.qsos.org) and create an account today.

### XulEditor
* Remote Templates can be downloaded from the QSOS repositories and used to create a new evaluation
* Remote evaluations can be downloaded from the QSOS repositories and opened by the editor
* Evaluations can be send and saved in the remote QSOS repositories, this requires authentication
* Evaluations can be resynchronized with local or remote templates

Install the [Firefox extention](http://backend.qsos.org/download/xuleditor-firefox-2.0.xpi) or the standaalone [application](http://backend.qsos.org/download/xuleditor-application-2.0.zip).

### O3S
* O3S connects to a QSOS repository by configuration
* Better GUI internationalization, including evaluations filtering on language
* Evaluations can now be visualized in HTML and Freemind format
* Comparisons can now be visualized on a QSOS Quadrant and also be exported to OpenDocument formats (ODS, ODP and ODT)

Connect to one of the two O3S instances:
* [Master](http://master.o3s.qsos.org): evaluations and templates validates by the QSOS community
* [Incoming](http://incoming.o3s.qsos.org): sandbox where anybody can propose contributions 

We will reinject former templates and evaluations in the coming days.

### Documentation
* New format and mechanism adopted

    + QSOS documentation is now written in [Markdown/Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) syntax

    + Two export format are used: PDF and Gitit wiki pages (to be available soon)

    + Export documents are built with `make`
