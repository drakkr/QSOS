QSOS is a community-based project: _the more we are, the better we are watching_!

So __join us__ in our effort to help people adopt open source software. You can contribute in many different ways, for instance:

* __Update__ an existing evaluation or template (check the [QSOS Tutorial](http://dist.qsos.org/qsos-tutorial-2.0_en.pdf) to see how to so so... in French ;))

* __Create__ a brand new template and/or evaluation (check the very same [tutorial](http://dist.qsos.org/qsos-tutorial-2.0_en.pdf))

* Be such a nice and frequent contributor that you'll be granted __commit__ right in the QSOS _Master_ backend ([this one](http://master.o3s.qsos.org/))

* Help on __code__ or [__edoc__](http://edoc.qsos.org) (fork the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/drakkr/qsos/>)

* __Advocate__ QSOS to people you know (padawans, coworkers, customers, friends...) or not (blog readers, conference attendees, magazine buyers, @followers... !)

* Any other creative way you'll find (sell/give T-shirts, make QSOS tatoos, have QSOS parties, mix all this in one event...)
