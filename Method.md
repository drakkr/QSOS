### Neat and free

QSOS proposes a method, designed to qualify, select and compare open source solutions in an objective, traceable and argued way.

### Proposed process

![QSOS process](https://raw.github.com/drakkr/QSOS/master/Method/en/Images/process-small_en.png)

The QSOS method describes a formal process to evaluate, compare and select open source solutions. This process is made up of four interdependent and iterative steps:

* __Define__ evaluation _templates_ structured as trees of evaluation criteria with two major axis: 
    
    * _Project_'s maturity: criteria fixed and made mandatory by QSOS whatever software family is considered

    * _Software_'s functional coverage: criteria depending on the considered software family

* __Evaluate__ open source solutions against templates by scoring the criteria
    
* __Qualify__ specific usage contexts by weighting the criteria

* __Select__ most relevant solutions identified through _comparisons_ based on scored and weighted criteria

This step by step approach, the multi criteria analysis and the scoring model defined by QSOS allow objective and traceable evaluation and selection of open source solutions.

This proves relevant when studying migration opportunity or when selecting the best open source solution in a given context.
